<h1>Global Hackers-in-Residence Program</h1>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>The HIR Program arranges for hackers to visit hackerspaces and other organizations around the world for prolonged periods of time for the purpose of sharing their skills, experience, and knowledge, as well as to learn from the hosting communities.  Any organization in the world can offer residency opportunities, and anyone in the world can apply for the opportunities offered.  This results in the cross-pollination of ideas, benefiting the hosting organizations, as well as the residents.</p>

<h2>Organization</h2>

<p>The terms of each residency are decided by the hosting hackerspace or other organization.  The terms are given by what is offered the prospective resident and what is required from the prospective resident, including the minimum duration and nature of the residency.  The free HIR Program serves to connect participating spaces with potentially interested hackers.</p>
